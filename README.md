#Unitale - Lua moddable Undertale engine

Welcome to the Git repository for Unitale! In the coming week, a more detailed write-up about open sourcing will be done.

In the meantime, you'll want to load the ModSelect scene from the Scenes folder. In the Battle scene, a script is attached to the Main Camera for loading a mod immediately from within the scene.

##Required files

To be able to run Unitale you'll need the default Undertale assets. The default Undertale assets are by Toby Fox (http://www.undertale.com) and used with permission.
The files from that .zip should be unpacked to the Assets folder of the project, they can be found here.

This is the overworld example mod, which should be extracted to the Mods folder.
